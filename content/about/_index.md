Hi! I'm Steven van Deursen and this is my blog. My blog posts are about software development, design, architecture, security, and everything that interests me concerning my profession.

I'm a Dutch freelance .NET developer and architect and writing code for the last {{% years-since 1998 %}} years. I'm a passionate speaker, coauthor of the [second edition](https://cuttingedge.it/book/) of the book “Dependency Injection in .NET” (also available in [Chinese](https://cuttingedge.it/book/chinese/), [Italian](https://cuttingedge.it/book/italian/), [Polish](https://cuttingedge.it/book/polish/), [Russian](https://cuttingedge.it/book/russian/), and [Japanese](https://cuttingedge.it/book/japanese/)), and the developer of [Simple Injector](https://simpleinjector.org); a popular DI Container library for .NET.

## Recent public talks

#### I'm doing Dependency Injection; What can go wrong?

Goes into the basics of DI, how bad design can still lead to the Constructor Over-Injection code smell, and how the Facade Services refactoring and the Composite design pattern can combat this.

  * @ [Exception Twente](https://exceptiontwente.nl). Enschede, The Netherlands. 2018-10 (Dutch)
  * @ [NMGN.tech](https://www.meetup.com/NMGNtech/). Nijmegen, The Netherlands. [2018-11](https://www.meetup.com/NMGNtech/events/256142465/) (Dutch)

#### Dependency Injection in .NET, what we’ve learned since the first edition

Discusses three key changes made in the second edition: How Ambient Context is an anti-pattern, Compile-Time Weaving is the opposite of DI because it causes tight coupling, and how Abstract Factories are a code smell.

  * @ [Cito](https://www.cito.nl/). Arnhem, The Netherlands. 2019-01

  * @ Microsoft Community BiH Conference. Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina. 2019-10

#### Can Dependency Injection be applied too much?

Goes into the basics of DI, the difference between Volatile and Stable Dependencies, the causes of Constructor Over-Injection, and possible refactorings.

  * @ [VECOZO's](https://vecozo.nl) [K!K Live](https://werkenbij.vecozo.nl/over-vecozo/KiK-live/). Tilburg, The Netherlands. 2022-09 [Dutch]
  
#### Next-Level Dependency Injection: The Peculiar Case of the One-Membered Interfaces.

In this talk I argue how the use of generic one-membered interfaces can lead to code that is open for extension, but closed for modification to prevent having to perform Shotgun Surgary on your code base.
