Hi! I'm Steven van Deursen and this is my professional blog. My blog posts are about software development, design, architecture, security, and everything that interests me concerning my profession.

I'm a Dutch freelance .NET developer and architect and writing code for the last 20 years. I'm a passionate speaker, coauthor of the [second edition](https://manning.com/seemann2) of the book “Dependency Injection in .NET”, and the developer of [Simple Injector](https://simpleinjector.org); an increasingly popular DI Container library for .NET.
