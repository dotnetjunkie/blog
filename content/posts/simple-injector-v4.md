### For the last months weâ€™ve been working on the next major release of Simple Injector, and it is finally here. We have removed legacy methods, simplified working with the library, and fixed many bugs and quirks.

Take a look at the [Simple Injector blog](https://simpleinjector.org/blog/2017/03/simple-injector-v4-has-been-released/) for more information about this new major release.
