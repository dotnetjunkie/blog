I am a privacy advocate and, as I'm font of my own privacy, I do respect yours. This means that I've gone through great length to prevent any tracking links and third-party cookies on my weblog. I did this by:

* Making local copies of fonts retrieved from Google that the used Hugo template referred to.
* Excluding any site analytics, such as Google Analytics.
* Refraining from using any tracking pixels and share buttons from Facebook, Twitter, Google, and LinkedIn.
* Refraining from using any third-party commenting systems, e.g. Disqus.
