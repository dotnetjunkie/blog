I am a privacy advocate and, as I'm font of my own privacy, I do respect yours. This means that I've gone through great length to prevent any tracking and third-party links on my weblog. I did this by:

* Making local copies of fonts retrieved from Google that the used Hugo template referred to.
* Excluding any site analytics, such as Google analytics.
* Refraining from using any tracking pixels and share buttons from Facebook, Twitter, Google, and LinkedIn.
* Refraining from using any third-party commenting systems, such as Disqus.

Due to the static nature of this website, no cookies or other information is persisted on your computer by my website.

But please be aware that this website is hosted on [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) (by storing the static HTML in [this](https://github.com/dotnetjunkie/dotnetjunkie.github.com) repository). Furthermore, my blog posts dynamically loads comments from GitHub by making use of [its API](https://developer.github.com/v3/). This means that your browser is in fact communicating with servers from GitHub. GitHub might store your visits in their log, using your IP address, but I have no way to find out.
